CM-11.0 NEW THEME ENGINE THEME!

This is my contribution to celebrate the new theme engine.

I have chosen to have this theme as an open source project, the 
source code can be used as a template, source code is available here

https://github.com/elelinux/GreatFreedom

To build this theme use eclipse or android-studio, to build from the source

GreatFreedom is a theme that is stylishly designed with solid colors, 
I tried to keep it as close to stock CM as possible apart from the icons.
